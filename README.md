## My build of Codex

If your looking to install the standardized version, you can
find that also [here](https://github.com/DaarkDev/codex).

This will include my modified ``main.lua`` primary file,
my ``config.lua`` file that this version has built-in support for,
as well as all of the other folders and files that are apart
of the "full package".

You will have to install this manually or follow slightly-modified
install instructions as seen in the link above, but it will not
be very difficult.

### Manual Installation

- Download the files from this repo
- Move them to ``/usr/local/bin``
- Chmod +x the ``sh`` file and all that other good stuff
- Done (most likely if under normal circumstances)

Note: *If you are a complete beginner or not on a version of linux and certain
software that will support this, then __DO NOT ATTEMPT!__ You __will most likely__ break your system
or screw something up.*
